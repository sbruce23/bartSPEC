Author: Yakun Wang

## Dependencies: 
Code was developed using R version 4.0.2 ("Taking Off Again"), so code
may not function properly on older versions of R.  The packages listed
in the main.R file must also be installed prior to use.

## Description:
1) **functions.r**: Contains all necessary functions to implement bartSPEC.
2) **main.r**: Demonstrates the proposed method via simulated data.
